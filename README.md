# pointcloud_cluster

This is a repository using **PCL library** and **ROS** for a few functions.

Compiled and tested in **ROS Indigo** and **Kinetic** with **catkin_make**

## Main Functions:
Point Cloud functions:
- PointCloud Filter
  - Vertical Feature Extraction
- PointCloud Registration
  - ICP localization
  - Read and show map from PCD format
  - Global localization (takes very long time as it is repeatedly iterating on every position on the map)
  
This repository is to enhance the capability of autonomous vehicles in **Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology - Future Urban Mobility - Autonomous Vehicle Group** which is funded by **National Research Funding**. The work has been published in **Development of A Self-Driving Personal Mobility Vehicle** by LEONG Wei Kang's Master Thesis in **National University of Singapore**.
